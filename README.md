Definitely Useful NLP Functions, which include:

### Finalized: 
#### *Automatic Yossarian*
Use it to erect more dynamic intralinear tensions and in just about every case leave a message that is far more universal. Works by deleting everything but "a", "an", and "the", unless the text starts with "Dear Mary", in which case you'll have to read the function to find out what happens next.

### In Progress:

#### *Computational Melville*
Given your name and phone number, this function calls you "Ishmael" via text message.

### Forthcoming:
#### *Dickensian Superlative Equivocation*
Multi-polar sentiment analysis, useful for figuring out if the current time, age, epoch, and season are any good at all.

#### *CD Ram Dass*
A combination timer and location-finding function that always returns "now" and "here."
