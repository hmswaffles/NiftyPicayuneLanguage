Definitely Useful NLP Functions, which include:

#### *Automatic Yossarian*
Use it to erect more dynamic intralinear tensions and in just about every case leave a message that is far more universal. Works by deleting everything but "a", "an", and "the", unless the text starts with "Dear Mary", in which case you'll have to read the function to find out more!

#### *Computational Melville*
Calls you "Ishmael" via text.
